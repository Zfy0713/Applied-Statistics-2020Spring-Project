 abstract = {A toxicological experiment analyzed by Pierce, Stewart and Kopecky (1979, Biometrics 35, 758-793) using Cox's proportional-hazards model is reanalyzed using mixture models which postulate a fraction of long-term survivors. The conclusions are seen to be potentially useful due to their simplicity and interpretability. Caution on the general use of mixture models is nevertheless advised.},
